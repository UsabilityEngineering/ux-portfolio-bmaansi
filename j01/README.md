# Generating a Reference

I use [PoseMy.Art](https://app.posemy.art/) to create and pick poses for reference when drawing. It is an easy solution when you have a pose in mind but cannot find a real person posing or you want a pose from a certain angle. They offer many features, like premade poses, lighting, and props so users can customize however they wish. 

The PoseMy.Art interface demonstrates **Error Prevention** and **User control and freedom**, two of the [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) for User Interface Design. These are the most important UI Designs that could have been provided because this application is not **learnable**. As you can see below there are many options for what to do with the model and many repeat symbols, that mean different things.

Before you begin drawing it is common to have multiple references, such as the setting, outfits, props, and pose. Many times I will have an idea I want to draw, but without a reference, the sketches will look abnormal. With PoseMy.Art I can create poses along with angles that would be difficult to find otherwise. Although I can envision the pose, it will not necessarily turn out how I expected. When posing the character, it is easy to make mistakes but being able to undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) is a godsend. Since the points can be rotated anyway, it will cause the pose to be abnormal. No artist wants the pose to look unnatural in a reference because that is the foundation of your drawing.

Although making your own pose is a hassle, you can bypass that easily by choosing one of their premade ones. Since the poses are premade, there is no concern about the poses looking unusual or unnatural. There is a large selection of poses to choose from but no categories to differentiate, so it can be difficult to find what you are looking for.

A **useful** feature available is locking the figures, camera, and lighting into place. There is no concern about misclicking and losing all of your work. Although they have undo and redo it only applies to the poses and lighting, not the camera angle. **Error Prevention** like this relaxes me because I don’t have to worry about losing the pose I made or it changing in the middle of drawing.  

In the reference above, we have a good camera angle, a dynamic pose, and lighting but we’re still missing something: shadows. Before I turn on the shadow, I need to ensure everything looks how I want it to look, because adding shadows will cause the website to run slowly. It does not feel **safe**, I worry that my laptop will crash every time I turn it on. Especially when the program is running with the shadows on in the background my laptop will lag.

The problem with the shadows can be inconvenient but to use the feature I would suggest screenshotting the reference you create with the shadows on. Turn off the shadow to avoid your laptop crashing or lagging for too long. I would also suggest sticking to the premade poses, there is a big variety and it is much easier than creating one on your own.
