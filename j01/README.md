# Generating a Reference

I use PoseMy.Art to create and pick poses for reference when drawing. It is an easy solution when you have a pose in mind but cannot find a real person posing or you want a pose from a certain angle. They offer many features, like premade pose, lighting, and props so users can customize however they wish. 

The PoseMy.Art interface demonstrates Error Prevention and User control and freedom, two of the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. These are the most important UI Designs that could have been provided because this application is not learnable. As you can see below there are many options for what to do with the model and many repeat symbols, that mean different things.

The one thing that doesn’t make you give up while using this app is User control and freedom, it is easy to make mistakes but being able to undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) is a godsend. When posing the character it is easy to feel overwhelmed. There are so many points that can be moved and even though I have an idea of the pose I want it won’t come out like I want. I want the pose to look as natural as possible, but since you are able to contort the figure any which way it rarely does.

Though making your own pose is a hassle, you can bypass that easily by choosing one of their premade ones. There is a large selection to choose from but no category, so it can be a bit of a mess. There is no concern about the poses looking off.

A useful feature available is locking the figures, camera, and lighting into place. There is no concern about misclicking and losing everything. Error Prevention like this relaxes me because I don’t have to worry about losing the pose I made or it changing in the middle of me drawing. Even though they have undo and redo it only applies to the poses and lighting. In this reference, we have a good camera angle, a dynamic pose, and lighting but we’re still missing something; shadows. Before I turn on the shadow, I need to make sure everything looks good because shadows will cause the website to run slowly. It does not feel safe, I worry that my laptop will crash every time I turn it on.
