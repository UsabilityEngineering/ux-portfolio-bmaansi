# Generating a Reference

I use [PoseMy.Art](https://app.posemy.art/) to create and pick poses for references when drawing. It is an easy solution when you have a pose in mind but cannot find a real person posing or you want a pose from a certain angle. They offer many features, like premade poses, lighting, and props so users can customize however they wish. Before you begin drawing it is common to have multiple references, such as the setting, outfits, props, and poses. Many times I will have an idea I want to draw, but without a reference, the sketches will look abnormal. With PoseMy.Art I can create poses along with angles that would be difficult to find otherwise. Although I can envision the pose, it will not necessarily turn out how I expected. 

The interface of this website is not learnable. It has many repeated icons that can confuse users, new and old. Even to do small tasks there is a learning curve, for example, if a user were to want to change the model it would take a bit of exploring to do so. As you can see below there are many options for what to do with the model and many repeated icons that mean different things.

As you can see in the pictures above, changing the character is nested, and there are many icons the user would have to look through to figure out what does what. This has low **visibility**.

The PoseMy.Art interface demonstrates **Error Prevention** and **User control and freedom**, two of the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). These are the two most important usability heuristics that could have been provided because the application is not learnable. When posing the character, it is easy to make mistakes but the website has common convention that most websites use for shortcuts. It allows the use of undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y), and clickable undo/redo easily identifiable icons.

But posing the characters can be difficult to do because it is not comparable to any other website that I have used previously. The joints can be rotated any which way, causing the pose to look unnatural. In these cases, it is good to have **error tolerance** so a user can recover from a mistake they have made. If you manage to click the rotation button a certain way then it allows for you to rotate the joints without having to use the circles. In this case the **conceptual model** matches my **mental model** more because if I bring the point forward it will bring the joint forward.

Posing your own character can be a hassle, you can bypass that easily by choosing one of the premade ones. The premade poses eliminate the concern about unnatural looking poses. There is a large selection of poses to choose from but no categories to differentiate, making it difficult to find what you are looking for.

There is error prevention for the poses, a feature available is locking the figures, camera, and lighting into place. There is no concern about misclicking and losing all of your work. Although they have undo and redo it only applies to the poses and lighting, not the camera angle. Error prevention like this can relax users because they don’t have to worry about losing the pose or changing it in the middle of drawing.

In the reference above, we have a good camera angle, a dynamic pose, and lighting but we’re still missing something: shadows. Before I turn on the shadow, I need to ensure everything looks how I want it to look, because adding shadows will cause the website to run slowly. It does not feel **safe**, I worry that my laptop will crash every time I turn it on. Especially when the program is running with the shadows on in the background my laptop will lag.

The problem with the shadows can be inconvenient but to use the feature I would suggest screenshotting the reference you create with the shadows on. Turn off the shadow to avoid your laptop crashing or lagging for too long. I would also suggest sticking to the premade poses, there is a big variety and it is much easier than creating one on your own.
